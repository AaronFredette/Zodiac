Constellation modules will place *.zip files here and Constellation is configured to install these files by name when they have not
been installed in the target Sitecore environment. You can make use of this functionality to deploy "mandatory" Sitecore data to your
installation during the Initialize pipeline using the Constellation.Foundation.PackageVerification library, which is installed in 
Zodiac by default. See the example configuration file in the Foundation folder for details on how to configure the deployment of
your own packages.
