        <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Foundation.Labels</strong>&nbsp;package included with Zodiac solves these problems</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Labels are defined in Data Templates, which means Field Names are the immutable "Key" half of the translatable Name-Value Pair.</li>
            <li>Each Feature should have a Label Group Data Template that covers any static, translatable text that the Feature needs. (Common Closure).</li>
            <li>Because Label Groups are Templates, they support Standard Values which immediately provides safe, global defaults for label text that are easy to revert if corrupted.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additionally, Foundation Labels offers advanced multi-site functionality</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Labels can be globally managed by Feature, but each Site can override Labels on a Feature-by-Feature need.</li>
            <li>Developers access Labels by requesting a Label Group object by C# Class name. Label "Keys" are Label Group class properties and are thus Intellisense compatible to reduce runtime bugs.</li>
            <li>Labels can be exposed as editable via Experience Editor or not, according to the Developer's choice.</li>
            <li>Although it's rare, Label Group properties can support the full suite of Sitecore fields. If you need a "translatable" Image, Foundation.Labels can support it.</li>
            <li>Label Groups are automatically available as JSON via a simple REST-based API for rich client applications.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This manual includes instructions and guidelines to help you successfully implement Label Groups.</p>
