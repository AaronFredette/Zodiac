        <p>Every website needs one, even if it is just to explicitly allow all robots onto the site. Zodiac ships with a dynamically generated robots.txt solution that allows the developer to configure behavior to be different for every site in the installation. For each site in the installation the developer can specify allowed and disallowed paths for site crawlers. Sitecore client paths are configured to be disallowed by default. Even if the developer does not mess with the Zodiac stock configuration, valid and reasonable robots.txt responses will be provided for all sites in the installation.</p>
        <p>The robots.txt file will also contain a link to our next feature...</p>
