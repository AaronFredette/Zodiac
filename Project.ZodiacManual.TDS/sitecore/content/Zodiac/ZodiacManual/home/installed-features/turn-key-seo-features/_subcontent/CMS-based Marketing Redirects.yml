        <p>While Zodiac also ships with a few custom IIS Url Rewrite 2.1 rules for high-level redirects, it also ships with a robust solution for 301/302 redirects to meet any SEO magician's needs.&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Redirects can be managed directly in Sitecore via a dedicated Sheer-compatible interface. (available via the Desktop start menu)</li>
            <li>Redirects use Buckets to circumvent the problems associated with Sitecore's own "Alias" technology.</li>
            <li>Redirects can be bulk exported/imported to allow for quick maintenance of the complete list of current redirects.</li>
            <li>The Redirect Manager UI has strict validation to prevent multi-redirect hops, duplicates, redirect loops, and dead-ends.</li>
            <li>Each Site in the installation has its own set of Redirect links.</li>
            <li>"Shorthand" URLs can be managed independently, as native Site "pages", allowing them to show up in dynamic navigation and to improve overall sitemap legibility.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Under the hood Redirects are managed as true Content Items and are bound by Publishing and Publishing cache clearing strategies.</p>
