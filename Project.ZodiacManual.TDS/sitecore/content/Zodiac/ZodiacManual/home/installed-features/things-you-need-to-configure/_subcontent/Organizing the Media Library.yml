        <p>Because most page fragments are Feature-level Data Source Items, any Image fields on these Items needs to have a fixed, site-independent folder in the media library to serve as the base location for related Images. There are benefits to this approach:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In a multi-site scenario, you know that all images in the folder are compatible with the Feature's output.</li>
            <li>You can tighten security in the Media Library to prevent users from uploading large amounts of unorganized files.</li>
            <li>You can favor a page-first approach to Media, insisting that an image need not be uploaded to Sitecore until it is determined that it absolutely, positively, needs to appear on a given page.</li>
        </ul>
