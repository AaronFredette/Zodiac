        <p>Particularly when accessing Sitecore's Pipelines, it is absolutely critical that a Pipeline Handler establish that the context of the running pipeline is valid for whatever customization it is supposed to execute.</p>
        <p>For example: Imagine an <strong>HttpRequestBeginPipeline</strong> processor that is supposed to evaluate the URL of the current request and assign the Context Item and Context Language based on details within that URL. Chances are, the pipeline processor was designed for a very specific condition on a specific site. However, the <strong>HttpRequestBeginPipeline </strong>is run for literally every request to Sitecore, regardless of Site or server role (CM or CD). The developer must therefore take pains to ensure that the pipeline processor&nbsp;<em>only&nbsp;</em>runs when the context of the Request is for the site that requires its logic.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Constellation.Foundation.Contexts</strong> module offers base classes for Pipeline Processors and Rule Actions that allow the developer to enforce a specific context through configuration files or at runtime, depending upon component. These base classes provide the developer with two distinct execution paths depending on whether the built-in context checker finds that the current context is a match against configured parameters.</p>
