        <p>Your new Label Items should exist in at least one location in the content tree, but can exist in multiple locations (one Item per Site). </p>
        <ul>
            <li>An Item must exist under <strong>/sitecore/content/_labels/</strong></li>
            <li>You may have site-specific versions of your Labels Item under <strong>{site root path}/_labels</strong></li>
            <li>You can choose whether to group your Label Items by Feature name (recommended) or not by adjusting a config setting in <strong>Foundation.Labels.config</strong>.</li>
            <li>Your Label Group item should be named identically to its Template name for legibility.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because Label Items can be accessed via a REST call, their names must be URL compatible. Items in both global and site-specific Labels folders will automatically be renamed to URL-compatible variations.</p><p>It is best practice to always create a global Label Item as soon as you are done defining its Template. I recommend having Site-level Label items as well to allow each Site to have internal consistency. If a Site uses a given Feature module, it should have a Label Item for it.</p>
