        <p>Zodiac has a convention-over-configuration approach when it comes to Views:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Zodiac prefers Controller renderings for everything except Sublayouts, which&nbsp;<em>must</em>&nbsp;be View Renderings.</li>
            <li>View file names must match the name of the Rendering Definition.</li>
            <li>View file paths on disk must match the path of the Rendering Definition.</li>
            <li>Zodiac Features that need Views must have an MVC Area for that Feature.</li>
            <li>Feature Area names must be formatted as "Feature_FeatureName" - Replace the "." with an "_".</li>
            <li>Zodiac Projects that need Views must have an MVC Area for that Project.</li>
            <li>Sites are Projects, Projects&nbsp;<em>must</em>&nbsp;be Sites in order for Zodiac to work properly.</li>
            <li>Project Area names <em>must </em>match the Site definition name in the Sitecore configuration files.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Zodiac has a unique concept of View Overrides.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Features&nbsp;<em>must</em>&nbsp;have a View implemented in their MVC Area for a given Rendering Definition.</li>
            <li>If your Site/Project requires different HTML than that provided by the Feature, you can&nbsp;<em>override</em>&nbsp;the Feature by providing a View of the same name and path in your Project's MVC Area.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Zodiac will&nbsp;prefer Site/Project Views over Feature views. It is up to the developer to determine if HTML changes initiated during a given Site/Project build should be promoted up to the Feature itself. In general Zodiac development favors multiple extremely simple Views over one View with lots of logic - HTML is not DRY - This is a fundamental development principle that helps keep runtime bugs down and site performance up.</p>
