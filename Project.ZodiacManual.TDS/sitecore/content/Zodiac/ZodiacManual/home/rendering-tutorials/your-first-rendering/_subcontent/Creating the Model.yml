        <p>To help get our hands dirty as fast as possible, we're going to start the development process in code. Launch Visual Studio 2019 and open up your local Zodiac-based project. Locate the <code>Feature.Content </code>project within the Solution Explorer. Right-click the <code>/Models</code> folder within that project and choose <strong>Add Class</strong>. Name your new class <code>CallToActionCardModel</code>.</p>
        <p>Our new Class will serve as the <code>ViewModel </code>for our component. It needs to be visible to the Controller, which will be part of this Feature project, as well as the downstream Views that will display its information.</p>
        <p>Make your new Class public, and add public properties that match the needs of the wireframe above.</p>
        <p>Use <code>HtmlString </code>as the property Type on any Text properties that you want to be available for click-&amp;-edit within Experience Editor.</p>
        <p>Use <code>ImageModel </code>as the property Type for the property that will support the card's header image.</p>
        <p>Use <code>GeneralLinkModel </code>as the property Type for the property that will hold the data for the button at the bottom of the card.</p>
