        <p>Helix best practice is to have as few Layout Items as possible. Zodiac best practice is to have Site-specific Layout items to allow for necessary deviations in the overall HTML document returned in responses. Some sites require more metadata than others, may use different HTML, Javascript or CSS frameworks, etc. Having at least one Layout per Site ensures that your install can handle the extremely volatile nature of front-end development.</p>
        <p>Because we're already in Sitecore, we're going to create the Layout Definition now. Later we'll add the file to the Visual Studio solution.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Under <code>/layout/Layouts/Project</code> create a new folder named after your Site.</li>
            <li>Create a new Layout with the following name structure: <code>[Site Name] Default Layout</code></li>
            <li>In the Path field, use the following Path structure: <code>~/Areas/[SiteName]/Views/Shared/[LayoutFileName].cshtml</code></li>
            <li>In the Area field, use <code>[SiteName]</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The long, explicit name for the Layout makes it very easy to see which layout is being applied when in the Presentation Details dialog for any given Item. If you neglect to put the Site name in the Layout name, you'll often have to puzzle out which "Default Layout" you're using. Suffixing the name with "Layout" also ensures that on disk the <code>*.cshtml</code> file has a clearly identifiable purpose, where <code>Default.cshtml</code> would be less useful.</p>
