        <p>Zodiac usually supports three stacked Roles for each Site in the installation. In order for them to work as described, you need to make an adjustment to the <code>/sitecore/Content</code> node's security settings. Unprotect the Item and Add a Security Setting for <strong>sitecore/Everyone</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Inherits Descendants (Disable)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This prevents any authenticated users from reading anything below <code>/sitecore/content</code> without explicit permission. Don't forget to set <strong>sitecore/Everyone (Read)</strong> permissions on any global folders you have immediately below <code>/sitecore/content</code>.</p>
        <h4>[SiteName] Site Reader</h4>
        <p>Allows Content Authors to see the Site node and its descendants in the Content Tree. This is the base role for all Content Authors for a given Site. This role is also useful if you want Content Authors on other Sites to be able to reference Content on this site, but not edit it.</p>
        <p>On the Site Root Node:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Read (Item, Descendants, Inherit, Inherit Descendants)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>[SiteName] Site Editor</h4>
        <p>Allows Content Authors to edit Pages in Experience Editor, including creating new pages and data source objects for any on-page Renderings.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Is a Member of <strong>[SiteName] Site Reader</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>On the Site's Home page Item:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Edit (Item, Descendants, Inherit, Inherit Descendants)&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Delete (Descendants, Inherit, Inherit Descendants) - Be careful here, make sure your users cannot delete the home page.</li>
            <li>Create (Item, Descendants, Inherit, Inherit Descendants)</li>
            <li>Rename (Descendants, Inherit, Inherit Descendants) - without this right, your content authors cannot adjust Page URLs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>On the Site's /Widgets folder:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Edit (Item, Descendants, Inherit, Inherit Descendants)</li>
            <li>Delete (Descendants, Inherit, Inherit Descendants) - Be careful here, make sure your users cannot delete the Widget folder.</li>
            <li>Create (Item, Descendants, Inherit, Inherit Descendants)</li>
            <li>Rename (Descendants, Inherit, Inherit Descendants)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you are going to restrict access to Media Items by site, you also need to set the following on any Site folders in the Media Library:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Edit (Descendants, Inherit, Inherit Descendants)&nbsp;- Don't let the user edit the Folder item.</li>
            <li>Delete (Descendants, Inherit, Inherit Descendants) - Be careful here, make sure your users cannot delete the Site folder.</li>
            <li>Create (Item, Descendants, Inherit, Inherit Descendants)</li>
            <li>Rename (Descendants, Inherit, Inherit Descendants)</li>
            <li>For the Sitecore/Everyone Role, set (Inherits, Item) to Deny.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>[Sitename] Site Owner</h4>
        <p>Allows Content Authors access to edit static Navigation and any Site-specific Label Groups.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Is a Member of<strong> [SiteName] Site Editor</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Inside the Site's <code>/Navigation</code> folder, on each Navigation Menu defined set the following security:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Edit (Item, Descendants, Inherit, Inherit Descendants)</li>
            <li>Delete (Descendants, Inherit, Inherit Descendants) - Be careful here, make sure your users cannot delete the Navigation Menu</li>
            <li>Create (Descendants, Inherit, Inherit Descendants)</li>
            <li>Rename (Descendants, Inherit, Inherit Descendants)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>On the Site's <code>/Labels</code> folder:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Edit (Item, Descendants, Inherit, Inherit Descendants)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Always set your Site Owner permissions at a point where the Content Author will not be able to delete or rename something that the system expects to exist for the site to function properly:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Label Group folders and Items (these may be representing JSON endpoints)</li>
            <li>Navigation Menus in the Navigation folder (don't let the Content Author delete the Primary Navigation for the site!)</li>
            <li>The Widgets folder and any sub-folders which may be serving as explicit Data Source Locations for Renderings.</li>
        </ul>
