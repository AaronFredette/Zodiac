        <p>When defining Security in a Zodiac project follow these rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each Role must address <strong>only one</strong> of the groups defined above (Sitecore Client, Workflow, Language, Site, or Template)</li>
            <li>You<strong> may not </strong>aggregate Sitecore Client Roles, even if you are&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;attempting to aggregate Sitecore Client roles.</li>
            <li>Role Names must begin with the Group they apply to (Workflow, Language, Site or Template)</li>
            <li>Roles within <strong>Workflow</strong>, <strong>Language</strong>, <strong>Site </strong>or <strong>Template </strong>can "stack" ex: <em>Site Owner </em>inherits from <em>Site Editor </em>inherits from <em>Site Reader</em>.</li>
            <li>Never,&nbsp;<em>ever</em>&nbsp;assign Item security to a specific user. Always use a Role.</li>
            <li>No content author should have the Admin flag checked on their account. This breaks Workflow. Create a discrete Admin account if necessary (hint: it should not be necessary)</li>
            <li>Users should be assigned at least one Role from each Group, not one single roll-up Role.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is&nbsp;<em>absolutely critical</em>&nbsp;that Developers do not cross security groups in a single Role, even if they are wrapping roles together into a single "content author scenario". Doing so makes it very difficult to look at a given User and understand the scope of their security, or make a minute adjustment to their security without breaking one of the above rules.</p>
