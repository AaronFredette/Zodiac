        <p>Zodiac demands the use of MVC Areas to segregate Views by Feature and Project. In the "Website" Project of your solution, navigate to the Areas folder and create a new Area named after your Site node in the Content Tree.</p>
        <p>After creating the Area, find the <code>[SiteName]AreaRegistration.cs</code> class that is generated by Visual Studio and comment out the <code>MapRoute</code> code located within it. Sitecore does not require MVC routing and it may cause interesting URL collisions, so it's best to delete it.</p><p>To assist in legibility, we recommend you delete the "Controllers", "Data", or "Models" folders that are created as part of the MVC scaffolding. This will prevent new developers from attempting to create Controllers and ViewModels within the Area. (Controllers and ViewModels belong in the Feature class library. Only Views belong in the Area.)&nbsp;</p>
