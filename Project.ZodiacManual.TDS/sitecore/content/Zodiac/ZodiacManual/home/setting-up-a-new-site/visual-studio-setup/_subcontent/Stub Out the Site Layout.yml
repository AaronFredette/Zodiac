        <p>When setting up the Content Tree we asked you to stub out a Layout Definition Item. Now we'll create the <code>cshtml</code> file on disk for it to connect to so we can get some feedback when we validate the site configuration.</p>
        <p>The Zodiac preference is to keep Layouts and Sublayouts (View Renderings) discrete from Views that serve Controller Renderings. This is because any non Layout/Sublayout Views in a Site's MVC Area are explicit overrides of Helix Feature output and need to be obviously identifiable as such.</p>
        <p>Layouts and Sublayouts for a site should be stored in <code>/Areas/[SiteName]/Views/Shared</code>.</p>
        <p>Layouts should have obvious names that help identify their use cases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Default</li>
            <li>JSON</li>
            <li>Home Page etc...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Layouts should be prefixed with the Site name to ensure legibility when viewing Presentation Details from the Content Editor.</p>
        <p>Layout and Sublayout names should be suffixed with "Layout" or "Sublayout" to clearly identify their purpose on disk and in the Renderings folder in the Content Tree.</p>
        <p>Create a basic CSHTML file at this location: <code>Website/Areas/[SiteName]/Views/Shared/[Sitename]DefaultLayout.cshtml</code></p>
        <p>Put something in the file so that you can see if your test requests are successful.</p>
